        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>Last updated: August 15th, 2019</p>

        <h2>1. General</h2>

        <p>These General Terms apply generally to the use of the service Whereby (the "Service" or “Whereby”), and constitute a contract between you and the company providing the Service, Video Communication Services AS, Gate 1 no. 101, 6700 Måløy, Norway ("The Company"). These terms govern your access to and use of the Whereby application and website (the "Service"), and any video, sound, text, graphics, or other materials sent, received, stored or otherwise appearing in the Service (collectively referred to as "Content"). Parts of the Service may display Content that is not Whereby's (“User Content”). Such content is the sole responsibility of the person or entity that has made it available.</p>

        <p>Where applicable, "The Company" shall also be understood as a reference to affiliates, suppliers, partners and other third parties Whereby may engage or otherwise cooperate with in connection with the Service</p>

        <p>By using Whereby you agree to these General Terms and the
          <a rel="nofollow" href="/information/tos/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>
          (collectively referred to as "Terms"). Please read them carefully. If you don’t agree to the Terms, you can’t use Whereby.</p>

        <p>We can change these Terms at any time. We keep a historical record of all changes to our Terms on GitHub. If a change is material, we’ll let you know before it takes effect. By using Whereby on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms. If you don’t agree to them, you should delete your account before they take effect, otherwise your use of the Service and Content will be subject to the new Terms. For paid versions of the Services or Content that you have already purchased, we will notify you at least 30 days prior to any material changes, including price changes.</p>

        <h2>2. Age limitation</h2>

        <p>Whereby is only for people

        <h2>3. How you can use the Service</h2>

        <p>Whereby is for legitimate individual use only (personal or business communication). Your use of Whereby requires that you have hardware, software and an Internet connection fulfilling certain recommended requirements, as may be specified in our FAQ. If the recommended requirements are not met, you may potentially still use the Service, but normally with a lower quality or performance.

If your payment is not successful, your room will be downgraded to the FREE plan with access to PRO features removed.

You can cancel the subscription at any time in the billing page, and you will then have access to PRO features for the remainder of the month you have paid for. When that month ends, your room will automatically be downgraded to the FREE plan.
